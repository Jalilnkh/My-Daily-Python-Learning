    "In this notebook, I will fine-tune an existing LLM from Hugging Face for enhanced machine translation. I will use the [MarianMT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/marian) model, which provides a high quality instruction tuned model and can translation text out of the box. To improve the inferences, you will explore a full fine-tuning approach and evaluate the results with BLEU metrics. Then you will perform Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), evaluate the resulting model and see that the benefits of PEFT outweigh the slightly-lower performance metrics."
