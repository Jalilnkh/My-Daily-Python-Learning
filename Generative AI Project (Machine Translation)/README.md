# Generative AI project life cycle

In this part I will use Generative AI course from Coursera and define GAI project life cycle.

## Scope
In my case I would like to make a machine translation project that can use LLMs.

## Model selection
I would choose a exsiting model that already trained on other data and will try to make a new model.
