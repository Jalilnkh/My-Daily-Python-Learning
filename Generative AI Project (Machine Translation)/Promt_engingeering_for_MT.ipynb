    "Welcome to the practical side of my generative AI project. In this lab I will do the machine translation task using generative AI. I will explore how the input text affects the output of the model, and perform prompt engineering to direct it towards the task I need. By comparing zero shot, one shot, and few shot inferences, I will take the first step towards prompt engineering and see how it can enhance the generative output of Large Language Models."
