    "A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that is a complete binary tree, satisfying the heap property: each parent node is either greater than or equal to (max-heap) or less than or equal to (min-heap) its children. This structure allows for efficient implementation of priority queues, where elements with higher priority (the largest or smallest value) can be accessed quickly. \n",
