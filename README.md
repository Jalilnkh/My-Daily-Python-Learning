My Daily Python Learning

This repository is a collection of my daily explorations and projects in Python, data science, and machine learning. It serves as a learning journal and portfolio, showcasing my progress and hands-on experience across a range of topics. The projects I’ve completed so far include:

- **Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis:** 
Data analysis project focused on uncovering insights from purchasing data, including trends, patterns, and predictive modeling.
- **Generative AI Project (Machine Translation):** 
Implementation and experimentation with generative AI models for translating text between languages.
- **Mathematics in Machine Learning:** 
A deep dive into the mathematical foundations of machine learning algorithms, with code examples and explanations.
- **RNNs Literature Review:**
A comprehensive review of research papers and developments in recurrent neural networks (RNNs), including code and summaries.
- **TCP Protobuf Vision Live Stream:** 
Real-time computer vision pipeline integrating TCP networking and Protocol Buffers for efficient data streaming.
This ongoing learning journey is documented here as I continually expand my Python and machine learning skill set.
- **Data Structures and Algorithm:**
Explorations of classic and modern data structures (lists, stacks, heaps, trees, graphs), and algorithms fundamental to computer science. This section includes implementations, visualizations, and complexity analyses to illustrate efficient problem-solving in Python. Hands-on exercises demonstrate searching, sorting, recursion, and more advanced topics such as dynamic programming and graph theory.  
These resources showcase my ongoing commitment to mastering computational thinking and algorithmic techniques relevant to real-world engineering and data science challenges.
