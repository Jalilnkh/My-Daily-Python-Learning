My-Daily-Python-Learning

This repository is a collection of my daily explorations and projects in Python, data science, and machine learning. It serves as a learning journal and portfolio, showcasing my progress and hands-on experience across a range of topics. The projects Iâ€™ve completed so far include:

Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis: Data analysis project focused on uncovering insights from purchasing data, including trends, patterns, and predictive modeling.
Generative AI Project (Machine Translation): Implementation and experimentation with generative AI models for translating text between languages.
Mathematics in Machine Learning: A deep dive into the mathematical foundations of machine learning algorithms, with code examples and explanations.
RNNs Literature Review: A comprehensive review of research papers and developments in recurrent neural networks (RNNs), including code and summaries.
TCP Protobuf Vision Live Stream: Real-time computer vision pipeline integrating TCP networking and Protocol Buffers for efficient data streaming.
This ongoing learning journey is documented here as I continually expand my Python and machine learning skill set.
